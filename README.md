# Wannacry

## Introduce

An imitation of Wannacry !

Originally I want to design a java virus to trick my friends. But then I find how ridiculous it is.
Once I kill process of jvm, the virus will be stopped also. So at last I just finish the UI.

On the other hand, I learned some points about packing jar file.
